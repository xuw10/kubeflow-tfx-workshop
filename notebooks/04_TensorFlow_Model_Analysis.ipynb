    "This notebook illustrates how TensorFlow Model Analysis (TFMA) can be used to investigate and visualize the characteristics of a dataset and the performance of a model.  We'll use a model that we trained previously, and now you get to play with the results!\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we trained was for the [Chicago Taxi Example](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-analysis/tree/master/examples/chicago_taxi), which uses the [Taxi Trips dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew) released by the City of Chicago.\n",

The City of Chicago makes no claims as to the content, accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of any of the data provided at this site. The data provided at this site is subject to change at any time.

    "\n",
    "Key Point: As a modeler and developer, think about how this data is used and the potential benefits and harm a model's predictions can cause. A model like this could reinforce societal biases and disparities. Is a feature relevant to the problem you want to solve or will it introduce bias?
